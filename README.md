ðŸ“š Learning and exploring the Algolia search platform.

## Overview

This project was scaffolded with Algolia's official tool: [create-instantsearch-app](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app)
and then I adapted it to my typical style.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and serve a web page that hosts Algolia search controls:

1. Pre-requisite: Node.js
   * I used version 18.17.1
2. Install dependencies:
   * ```shell
     npm install
     ```
3. Set the Algolia key and ID
   * Hardcode it in the code. This is ok for demo purposes and because they aren't actually secrets because they are
     meant to be used in client-side code.
4. Build and serve the page continuously with the development server:
   * ```shell
     npm start
     ```
5. Open the page and try it out
   * Open the browser to <http://localhost:1234>.
   * Search for something, like "Node.js". The page is making requests to the Algolia servers to execute the search. 


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Facet search. What does facet search look like on the UI-side using the InstantSearch library? What config do I
  need to do on the server-side (the Algolia index)?
  * This is generally called "Refinements" in the Algolia documentation.
  * Related docs: [*Facet Display in React InstantSearch*](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/facet-display/react/)
  * DONE Configure "author_name" as an attributing for faceting in the Algolia index configuration via the Algolia dashboard.
  * DONE Add a "RefinementList" widget to the InstantSearch configuration.
  * DONE Style the refinement list. It's appearing at the bottom of the page.
* [ ] [Structured results](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/structured-results/react/).
  This is more of a concept than a technology. I just to show the "category". Well, maybe I can style
  certain categories different, and that counts as structured. Anyway, the idea of making certain attributes pop in a
  search result and making differentiated results is interesting.
* [ ] Can Parcel splice in some values to my index.html (or maybe .tsx files)? Hard coding the key is not idea.
