## Overview

This project was scaffolded with Algolia's official tool: [create-instantsearch-app](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app)
and then I adapted it to my typical style.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and serve a web page that hosts Algolia search controls:

1. Pre-requisite: Node.js
   * I used version 18.17.1
2. Install dependencies:
   * ```shell
     npm install
     ```
3. Build and serve the page continuously with the development server:
   * ```shell
     npm start
     ```
4. Open the page and try it out
   * Open the browser to <http://localhost:1234>.
   * Search for something, like "Node.js". The page is making requests to the Algolia servers to execute the search.
